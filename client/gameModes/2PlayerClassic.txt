Everything before the main section is considered a comment and ignored.

Each player gets a controller. Controllers will be initialized with default controls for the first four controllers, and blank controls after that.
In release it will be possible to rebound controls anyway.

Main includes generic game information. If no other spcifications about balls and paddles are made defaults should be used for the number of objects specified in paddle.
(i.e. Paddles centered on left and right walls and the ball in the center with a random (or predefined velocity))
Field refers to the total size of the arena.
Local refers to the locally visible section, this obviously doesn't do anything yet.
Walls should be constructed to bound the field area similarly to how they are now in the gameManager.

Teams includes information about each team to be created and what they control.
Players are numbered, starting at 0, human players first. (i.e. {0 (human), 1 (human), 2 (ai), 3 (ai)}  )
A co-op team might look like:
	team1Player={0,1}
Goals are defined by their
